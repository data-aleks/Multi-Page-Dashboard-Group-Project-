# üìä Multi-Page Dashboard ‚Äî Group Project

## Overview
This project was initiated outside of allocated bootcamp hours as a collaborative effort among participants of a **Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp**. The goal was to bring together individuals who had never met before to work as a team on a **data analytics and dashboarding challenge**.

Over the course of **four weeks**, our team of five members‚Äîeach bringing expertise in **Project Management, Data Analytics, Web Analytics, and Sports Analytics**‚Äîworked beyond the bootcamp structure to develop a fully functional multi-page dashboard.

We conducted regular **Zoom meetings** after bootcamp sessions and established **Slack channels** to streamline communication and workflow.

- **02.05 ‚Äî Second Meeting:**  
  - Set up Slack and Zoom communication channels  
  - Chose the dataset and initiated technical work  
  - Data cleaning tasks: removing trailing spaces, ensuring correct data types  

### üîπ Week 2: Project Framework & Dashboard Structure
- **07.05 ‚Äî Third Meeting:**  
  - Proposed a **star schema model** to replace the previous **snowflake model**  
  - Merged `Orders` and `OrderDetails` tables into a single **Fact Table** in Power BI

- **08.05 ‚Äî Fourth Meeting:**  
  - Refined main pages and subcategories  
  - Shared example dashboard screenshots  
  - Added key DAX measures for dashboard insights:

    ```DAX
    Month Total Revenue =
    CALCULATE(
        SUM(Fact_Orders[OrderRevenue]),
        DATEADD(Dim_Date[Date], 0, MONTH)
    )

    Prev Month Total Revenue =
    CALCULATE(
        SUM(Fact_Orders[OrderRevenue]),
        PREVIOUSMONTH(Dim_Date[Date])
    )

    Revenue per Customer =
    DIVIDE(
        SUM(Fact_Orders[OrderRevenue]), 
        DISTINCTCOUNT(Dim_Customers[CustomerID]), 0
    )

    Prev Month Revenue per Customer =
    CALCULATE(
        DIVIDE(SUM(Fact_Orders[OrderRevenue]), DISTINCTCOUNT(Dim_Customers[CustomerID]), 0), 
        PREVIOUSMONTH(Dim_Date[Date])
    )

    Latest Month Total Quantity =
    CALCULATE(
        SUM(Fact_Orders[Quantity]), 
        DATEADD(Dim_Date[Date], 0, MONTH)
    )

    Prev Month Total Quantity =
    CALCULATE(
        SUM(Fact_Orders[Quantity]), 
        PREVIOUSMONTH(Dim_Date[Date])
    )

    Total Unique Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Fact_Orders[OrderID])
    ```

### üîπ Week 3: Implementation & Feature Testing
- **12.05 ‚Äî Fifth Meeting:**  
  - Finalized **drill-down hierarchy** and ensured consistency  
  - Optimized data alignment across dashboard sections  

- **13.05 ‚Äî Sixth Meeting:**  
  - Integrated **role-based access control (Manager - Germany, Manager - USA)**  
  - Implemented **row-level security**  

### üîπ Week 4: Enhancements & Optimization
- **14.05:**  
  - Added a **Date Dimension Table** for time intelligence calculations  
  - Moved away from relying solely on the fact table for dates  
  - Learned new Power BI techniques through Microsoft Learn  
  - Optimized performance and UX

## üèóÔ∏è Dashboard Structure
The dashboard follows a **multi-page drill-down approach** for seamless navigation:

### **Main Pages**
- Products  
- Customers  
- Suppliers  
- Shippers  
- Categories  

### **Overview Pages**
- Product Overview  
- Category Overview  
- Supplier Overview  
- Shippers Overview  

Each main page leads to **detailed drill-down sections**, ensuring **insightful data exploration**.
